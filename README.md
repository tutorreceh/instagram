## What is this?
Sometimes checking your instagram during work is kind of strange, so why not check your instagram inside your terminal?
OK... I know checking this during work is still strange... :expressionless:
To be honest, I did this just for pure fun.

Please donâ€™t forget to star this repo if you liked it!! :wink::wink:

## Getting Started
#### Installation
```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

Just that easy!! :sunglasses:

## Updates
* 2FA implemented (2018.03.31)

## Note
For the username and password part, I promise you it is safe even if you save it. The username/password will only be saved locally in the file called `credential.json`. You can also just don't save it which is the default option. 

You can check this out in the source code. :innocent:
